# Comperio - Tutoring Session Booking Platform - Frontend

Welcome to the frontend part of the Comperio tutoring booking app! This project provides an intuitive and responsive interface for students at the Faculty of Engineering and Computing to connect with tutors and book sessions seamlessly. "Comperio" is derived from Latin, symbolizing the pursuit of learning. Users can register/log in as either a student or instructor and start looking for opportunities to give/receive tutoring to fellow students. 

**Note:** This platform is a work in progress. Some features may still be under development, and we appreciate your patience as I continue to improve the application.
